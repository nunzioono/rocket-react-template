# rocket-react-template
A fully featured react + rocket-rs (+ docker for production) template for building web applications that use both fast frontend and backend frameworks

# installation
Requires to have on your system node and rust installed if you want to run it locally.
Requires to have docker installed if you want just to produce the image and then use it in production.
Either in these cases run the build script accordingly to your os:
- Windows -> build.ps1
- MacOs/Linux -> build.sh

# important
The template assumes in the build scripts custom names for the docker image so if you don't want to lose time modify the script you are interested in with your desired name
